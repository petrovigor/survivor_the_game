# Survivor

A simple minimalism shooter game.
Main idea is to create sandbox environment like GTA or Dishonored games have.

Player will explore the world fully automatically procedurally generated.

# Controls

Movement: WASD

Primary weapon: LMB

Secondary weapon/special ability: RMB

Change primary weapon: digits in range [1, 6]

# Technology

Code & file structure needs to be refactored.

Powered via WinAPI and native GDI renderer. Just a hobby project.
Supported OS: Windows

This project is a practice to create nice physics engine architecture.
Later code may be modified to extend WinAPI window and event system with Linux ones.

# Build

now build via .sln
